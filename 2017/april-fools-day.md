2017 April Fool's Day Challenge & Competition
---------------------------------------------

Rules
=====
* No flooding.
* No use of ALL CAPS text. Turn off your caps lock.
* No additional bots in the channel. Only ChanServ and jenni are allowed.
* No automated scripts. (eg: No automatic /me's or messages when you go "away")
* No personal insults.
* English is the preferred language, other languages are allowed but in small amounts. Please try to use English as the primary language for communication.
* As always do not violate any freenode policies: https://freenode.net/policies


Tips and Guidelines
===================
* You *can* solve all of this without actually coding anything
* You *can* solve all of this with just a web browser and access to a useful search engine, https://duckduckstart.com/
* The official channels will be registered to the IRC account of **ircpuzzles** and will all begin with `######` (that's six (6) `#`)
* You can quickly see if a channel exists with: `/mode ######channel_name`
* Pay attention to the theme or patterns among the levels you have solved.
* All clues/hints are relevant to solve the level they are on. Other channel information may be useful in solving puzzles.
* Please don't part channels after you solve the level, because many times we like to say someone made it to the next level and this makes it obvious that it was you, and we don't want to out who made it to which level until the game is over (so you don't get harassed in PM.)
* freenode channel names are **not** case sensitive
* The *clue* is, by itself, the main puzzle for each level.
* The *hints* are to help point you in the right direction with the *clue*.
* This year, `|||` separates initial clues from hints added after play feedback.
* freenode's maximum channel name length is 50-characters (including the `#` hashes).
